# API Key Management

API keys authenticate your applications with the Pictify API. This guide covers creating, managing, and securing your keys.

## Creating an API Key

1. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**
2. Click **Create Key**
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Server", "CI/CD Pipeline")
4. Click **Create**
5. **Copy the key immediately** - it's only shown once

<Warning>
Store your API key securely. You won't be able to see it again after leaving this page.
</Warning>

## Key Types

### Live Keys

- Prefix: `pk_live_`
- Full API access
- Usage counts against your plan
- Use in production

### Test Keys

- Prefix: `pk_test_`
- Limited to 100 renders/day
- Renders are watermarked
- Use for development and testing

## Viewing Keys

The API Keys page shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Your key description |
| **Key ID** | Public identifier (e.g., `key_abc123`) |
| **Type** | Live or Test |
| **Created** | Creation date |
| **Last Used** | Most recent API call |
| **Status** | Active or Revoked |

<Note>
For security, only the Key ID is displayed. The full key value is only shown at creation.
</Note>

## Managing Keys

### Rename a Key

1. Click the **...** menu on a key
2. Select **Rename**
3. Enter the new name
4. Click **Save**

### Revoke a Key

Revoking a key immediately invalidates it:

1. Click the **...** menu on a key
2. Select **Revoke**
3. Confirm the action

<Warning>
Revoking a key is immediate and permanent. Any applications using this key will stop working.
</Warning>

### Delete a Key

Remove a key from your account:

1. Click the **...** menu on a key
2. Select **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

Only revoked keys can be deleted.

## Key Limits

| Plan | Live Keys | Test Keys |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Free | 2 | 5 |
| Pro | 10 | 10 |
| Business | 50 | 50 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | Unlimited |

## Usage Tracking

### Per-Key Usage

View usage for each key:

1. Click a key to expand details
2. See requests in the last 24h, 7d, 30d
3. View error rates and latency

### Usage Alerts

Set up alerts for unusual activity:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Alerts**
2. Click **Add Alert**
3. Configure conditions:
   - Requests exceed threshold
   - Error rate above percentage
   - Latency above threshold
4. Choose notification method (email, Slack, webhook)

## Security Best Practices

### Use Descriptive Names

Name keys by their purpose:

```
✅ "Production API Server"
✅ "Staging Environment"
✅ "GitHub Actions CI"
❌ "Key 1"
❌ "Test"
```

### Rotate Keys Regularly

Schedule regular key rotation:

1. Create a new key
2. Update your application
3. Verify the new key works
4. Revoke the old key

### Use Test Keys for Development

Never use live keys in development:

```bash
# Development
PICTIFY_API_KEY=pk_test_...

# Production
PICTIFY_API_KEY=pk_live_...
```

### Monitor for Misuse

Watch for signs of compromised keys:

- Unexpected usage spikes
- Requests from unknown IPs
- Unusual error patterns

### Principle of Least Privilege

Create separate keys for different services:

| Service | Key | Access |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Web App | `prod-webapp` | Full access |
| Mobile App | `prod-mobile` | Full access |
| Analytics | `prod-analytics` | Read-only |
| CI/CD | `ci-pipeline` | Test key |

## Environment-Specific Keys

### Development

Use test keys with a local `.env`:

```bash
# .env.local
PICTIFY_API_KEY=pk_test_development_key
```

### Staging

Use test keys for staging environments:

```bash
# staging.env
PICTIFY_API_KEY=pk_test_staging_key
```

### Production

Use live keys, stored securely:

```bash
# Set via secrets manager, not in files
PICTIFY_API_KEY=pk_live_production_key
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error

1. Verify the key is correct (no extra spaces)
2. Check the key hasn't been revoked
3. Ensure you're using the right key type (live vs test)

### Key Not Working After Creation

1. Wait a few seconds - propagation takes up to 30 seconds
2. Verify you copied the full key
3. Check for encoding issues if copying from another source

### Usage Not Updating

Usage statistics may have up to 5 minutes delay. Real-time usage is available in the API response headers.

## API Key API

Manage keys programmatically with the [API Keys API](/api-reference/keys):

```bash
# List keys
curl https://api.pictify.io/v1/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY"

# Create key
curl -X POST https://api.pictify.io/v1/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "New Production Key", "type": "live"}'
```

<Note>
API key management requires an admin-level key with key management permissions.

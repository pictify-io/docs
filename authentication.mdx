# Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key passed in the `Authorization` header.

## API Keys

API keys are created in your [dashboard settings](https://pictify.io/dashboard/settings). Each key is associated with your team and has access to all team resources.

### Creating an API Key

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys** in the dashboard
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Server", "Development")
4. Copy the key immediately - it won't be shown again

<Warning>
API keys provide full access to your account. Keep them secure and never expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pictify.io/v1/image \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pk_live_abc123..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"html": "<h1>Hello</h1>"}'
```

### SDK Configuration

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Node.js
import { Pictify } from '@pictify/sdk';

const pictify = new Pictify({
  apiKey: process.env.PICTIFY_API_KEY
});
```

```python Python
from pictify import Pictify

client = Pictify(api_key=os.environ["PICTIFY_API_KEY"])
```

```go Go
client := pictify.NewClient(os.Getenv("PICTIFY_API_KEY"))
```

```ruby Ruby
client = Pictify::Client.new(api_key: ENV['PICTIFY_API_KEY'])
```
</CodeGroup>

## API Key Types

| Prefix | Type | Environment |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `pk_live_` | Production | Live API access |
| `pk_test_` | Test | Sandbox environment |

Test keys work identically to production keys but are rate-limited and do not count against your quota.

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

Never hardcode API keys. Use environment variables:

```bash
# .env
PICTIFY_API_KEY=pk_live_abc123...
```

### Server-Side Only

API keys should only be used in server-side code. Never include them in:
- Client-side JavaScript
- Mobile apps
- Public repositories
- Browser localStorage/cookies

### Key Rotation

If you suspect a key has been compromised:
1. Create a new API key in the dashboard
2. Update your application to use the new key
3. Delete the compromised key

### Least Privilege

Create separate API keys for different environments and services:
- Production server
- Staging server
- CI/CD pipeline
- Local development

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited by API key:

| Plan | Requests per Minute | Requests per Day |
|------|--------------------:|----------------:|
| Free | 60 | 1,000 |
| Pro | 300 | 10,000 |
| Business | 1,000 | 100,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

Rate limit headers are included in every response:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 300
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 299
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1706515260
```

When rate limited, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `Retry-After` header:

```json
{
  "type": "https://docs.pictify.io/errors/rate-limit",
  "title": "Rate Limit Exceeded",
  "status": 429,
  "detail": "You have exceeded the rate limit. Please retry after 60 seconds.",
  "instance": "/v1/image"
}
```

## Team API Keys

API keys are scoped to your team. All team members share access to the same API keys and resources.

To manage team members:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Team**
2. Invite members by email
3. Assign roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer)

Only Admins can create, view, and delete API keys.

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid API Key

```json
{
  "type": "https://docs.pictify.io/errors/invalid-api-key",
  "title": "Invalid API Key",
  "status": 401,
  "detail": "The provided API key is invalid or has been revoked."
}
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify the key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Check if the key has been deleted in the dashboard
- Ensure you're using the correct environment (test vs production)

### Missing Authorization Header

```json
{
  "type": "https://docs.pictify.io/errors/missing-auth",
  "title": "Missing Authentication",
  "status": 401,
  "detail": "No API key provided. Include your API key in the Authorization header."
}
```

**Solutions:**
- Add the `Authorization: Bearer {api_key}` header
- Check for typos in the header name
